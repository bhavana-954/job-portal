# job-portal
This is a Job Portal web application that allows users to search for jobs, apply for them, and manage job postings. The system includes role-based access control (Admin, Company, Job Seeker) and authentication using JWT.



✅ What's Working?
✔ Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Company, Job Seeker)
✔ JWT Authentication for secure login
✔ Basic Job Posting & Application System
✔ Database Integration with MongoDB
✔ Frontend UI Setup with Next.js & Tailwind CSS



🚧 What's Missing?
❌ Dashboard Enhancements (For Companies to manage job postings)
❌ Resume Upload Functionality
❌ Job Search & Filtering Features
❌ Optimized Database Queries (Need Prisma/Sequelize integration)
❌ Full Deployment (Backend & Frontend)


🔧 How Would I Complete It with More Time?
🔹 Complete Backend Features: Add missing APIs for job applications & admin controls.
🔹 Enhance UI: Improve the frontend with better job listing & filtering.
🔹 File Uploads: Enable job seekers to upload resumes.
🔹 Deploy Backend & Frontend: Host backend on Render/Fly.io and frontend on Vercel.
🔹 Testing & Optimization: Debug & optimize API responses for better performance.
